To add all files in the staging area
>> git add .
// Check whether it is added
>> git status

// It is in staging area, we need to commit the changes
// With Messages
>> git commit -m "Committed"
// Without Messages
>> git commit
	

// To see which branch your local branch is tracking from the remote, run:
>> git branch -vv

// After staged (git add .), suppose if to unstage the staged documents/changes
>> git restore --staged <staged_FileName.type>
>> git restore --staged AdditionalFile.txt

//To see the history in cmd prompt
git log --oneline

// To uncommit the error one. The committed Id could be taken from "git log"
>> git reset <commited ID>

Note: The committed ids will be in the order as 
1 - commit 1
2 - commit 2
3 - coomit 3

1 is the base for 2 & 3. So, if base 1 is deleted, then commit 2 & 3 will also be deleted.
It is like the chain of action.
